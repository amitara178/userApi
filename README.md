To Odaya kardashov
I don't want to edit the file without permission so Im writing here.
I accidentally uploaded a bad version.
for the code  work you need to delete the "models" folder.
and in the RndomApiController class
on line 152 in the signature change string name to string email
and in line 154 change u.Name==name to u.Email==email

After that all functions will work.
If you give me permission, I will do it myself.

And I hope that because of this pressure mistake I will be not disqualified.

Thanks in advance Amit Ara
